# Scikit-Learn Implementation on Historical Data
This repository demonstrates the implementation of the scikit-learn library for machine learning on historical data. It focuses on working with Python 3 and data manipulation using the pandas library.

If you find this repository helpful, please consider giving it a star.

## Contents
- ML_setup_func.py:
    - This file contains functions that facilitate data manipulation, model training, and testing using machine learning models imported from the scikit-learn library.
- data_formating.ipynb:
    - This Jupyter Notebook provides a guide to manipulate historical, unstructured CSV data files found in the "data" folder.
- ML_setup_accuracy_linear.ipynb:
    - In this Jupyter Notebook, we utilize the scikit-learn library to train and predict future draw results based on historical, structured CSV data files generated from the data_formating.ipynb file.

## Folders
- data/:
    - This folder contains historical, unstructured CSV data files. These files serve as the raw data for analysis and modeling.
- model_linear/:
    - The model_linear folder stores trained machine learning models in the form of .pkl files. These models can be loaded and used for making predictions.

## Getting Started
Follow the Jupyter Notebooks (data_formating.ipynb and ML_setup_accuracy_linear.ipynb) to explore the data, preprocess it, and train machine learning models.
## Usage
You can use this repository as a starting point for implementing scikit-learn on your own historical data. Modify the provided code and notebooks to suit your specific use case and dataset.
